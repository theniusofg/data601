Services for students with disabilities are provided for all students qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the ADAAA of 2009, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate reasonable accommodations that would allow students to have equal access and inclusion in all courses, programs, and activities of the University. If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations, please register with the Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) as soon as possible. To begin the registration process please visit the SDS website and review the registration information, including disability documentation guidelines and how to submit the SDS registration form online using the confidential data management software called Accommodate . Once accommodations have been approved, you and your instructors will be notified via an emailed accommodation letter from the SDS office. Both the SDS office and Shady Grove's Center for Academic Success(CAS) will work with you to ensure you receive the approved accommodations. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services via  or phone at 410-455-2459. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and begin once SDS sends an approved accommodation letter. For more information on the services CAS provides, please contact Mary Gallagher () or visit .\n"
