    - When Online: Link will be shared via Blackboard


## Instructor Mehmet Sarica

Office Hours: https://calendly.com/msarica1/15min

## Q&A and Discussions

We will be using Blackboard for email, questions, and class discussions. Rather than emailing questions, I highly encourage you to post your questions on Blackboard.
## Course Description

The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to and hands on experience with all phases of the data science process using real data and modern tools. Topics that will be covered include data formats, loading, cleaning, data storage in relational & non-relational stores and data visualization.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:

1. Describe the key activities in a data science project.
2. Use popular Python packages for data visualization.
3. Use Pandas library for data transformations.
4. Evaluate the quality of a dataset for a given data science project.
5. Create functions and programs that are cleaning and transforming raw data sets.
6. Load, read and write from different data sources.
7. Apply basic statistical knowledge in a data science project to test and verify hypotheses.
8. Create new data sets by combining data from different sources.
9. Understand the role of modeling in a data science project.
10. Apply best practices of communication for reporting when they finish a data science project.

<!-- ## Covid-19

Covid-19
Due to the global pandemic, our classes will be held remotely this semester.
Please see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWWGAR8qEzKYr7qaVHoEhvO6lyXIyn6M3M7EFZPJQgA/ for UMBC Policies and Resources during COVID-19. -->

## Github Repository

I will use https://github.com/msaricaumbc/DS601_Fall21 as our course webpage. You can check this page for updates and important information related to the course.

## Textbooks

We will not be following one single textbook in this course. Weekly reading materials and relevant course materials will be shared beforehand via Blackboard and/or course’s Github repository. In addition to these, I will be following the logical structures of the following textbooks.

- Python Data Science Handbook: We will follow this book when we want to learn programming with Python part of the course. Especially sections related to Pandas library is pretty well written. 
[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)


## Course Format and Assignments

Students will complete assigned homework assignments, readings, projects. This course incorporates a variety of hands-on labs and practical exercises to engage students and prepare them for challenges they may encounter in a workplace.

The final project will provide students opportunity to showcase what they have learned in a format similar to what they will encounter in a professional work setting.

## Grading Criteria

Students are expected to participate in class discussions. Student participation is encouraged & expected; watching recorded lectures outside of class does not count towards attendance!

Homework assignment will be mostly due Sunday. For homework due dates please check the weekly schedule below.

Services for students with disabilities are provided for all students qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the ADAAA of 2009, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate reasonable accommodations that would allow students to have equal access and inclusion in all courses, programs, and activities of the University.
If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations, please register with the Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) as soon as possible. To begin the registration process please visit the SDS website and review the registration information, including disability documentation guidelines and how to submit the SDS registration form online using the confidential data management software called Accommodate https://sds.umbc.edu/accommodations/registering-with-sds/. 
Once accommodations have been approved, you and your instructors will be notified via an emailed accommodation letter from the SDS office.  Both the SDS office and Shady Grove's Center for Academic Success(CAS) will work with you to ensure you receive the approved accommodations. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services via disAbility@umbc.edu or phone at 410-455-2459. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and begin once SDS sends an approved accommodation letter.
